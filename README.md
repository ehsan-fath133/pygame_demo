### File discription
- `main.py` - main file used to run the flappy bird game
- `game.py` - stores game logic, bird, pipes and collision
- `assets/` - folder for images used in the game
- `highscore.txt` - saves the best score of the player
- `requirements.txt` - list of python packages needed by the project
- `.gitignore` - tells git which files and folders should not be tracked
- `README.md` - contains the project documentation

## Requirement
Before running the project, make sure you have:
- `python 3`
- `pygame`

## Installation
1. open a terminal in the project folder.
2. check that python is installed
```bash
python --version
```

3. install the python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Envoirment Setup
This project does not need a `.env` file.

If you want, you can add extra settings later, for example:
- window width and height
- bird speed
- pipe gap size

No secret password or private key is required to play the game.

## Usage
1. open a terminal in the project folder
2. run the game
```bash
python main.py
```
3. press `SPACE` or click to make the bird flap
4. try to fly between the pipes without hitting them
5. after game over, press `R` to play again or `ESC` to exit

## Example Output
When the game starts, a window opens with:
- a bird in the middle of the screen
- green pipes moving toward the bird
- the current score at the top of the screen

Example terminal message:

```text
Flappy Bird started
High score: 12
Press SPACE to flap
```

After the bird hits a pipe:

```text
Game Over
Your score: 7
High score: 12
Press R to restart
```
